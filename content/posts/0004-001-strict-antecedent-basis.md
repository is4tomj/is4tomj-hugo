## Strict Antecedent Basis

"It is of utmost importance that patents issue with definite claims that clearly and precisely inform persons skilled in the art of the boundaries of protected subject matter." [MPEP 2173](https://www.uspto.gov/web/offices/pac/mpep/s2173.html); see 35 U.S.C ยง 112(b). Unfortunately, the English language is too flexible and too complicated for many people to write a clear claim.

Strict Antecedent Basis is a standard that eliminates many ambiguities caused by lazy or novice claim drafters. Strict Antecedent Basis rules are specifically tailored to draft claims that clearly meet the standards of the USPTO and US law.

The following posts define the Strict Antecedent Basis rules and provide numerous examples. New posts will be added to this list and posts may be updated over time.
