## Blocks

A block is a group of components or steps that are related. Blocks should be visually identifiable with indentation. The first line of a block should end with a `:` and each subsequent line in the block should have a deeper indentation than the first line of the block. The second to last line should end with either `; and` or `, and`, whichever is more appropriate.  The following is an example of a block.

``` claim
for each thing among a plurality of things:
  doing a first action with the thing; 
  doing a second action with the thing;
```

## Nested Blocks

A block may include one or more blocks.  The following is an example of a block that includes a block.

``` claim
A method comprising:
  receiving a plurality of things;
  for each thing in the plurality of things:
    doing a first action with the thing; 
    doing a second action with the thing.
```
