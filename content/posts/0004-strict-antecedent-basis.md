## Strict Antecedent Basis

"It is of utmost importance that patents issue with definite claims that clearly and precisely inform persons skilled in the art of the boundaries of protected subject matter". [MPEP 2173](https://www.uspto.gov/web/offices/pac/mpep/s2173.html); see 35 U.S.C ¬ß 112(b). Unfortunately, the English language is too flexible and too complicated for many people to write a clear claim.

Strict Antecedent Basis is a standard that eliminates many ambiguities caused by lazy or novice claim drafters. Strict Antecedent Basis rules are specifically tailored to clearly meet the standards of the USPTO and US law.

## Noun phrases -- the building blocks of clear claim language

A noun phrase is a word or group of words that functions in a sentence as subject, object, or prepositional object. A noun phrase in a claim should be clearly defined so that future references to the noun phrase are easily recognized.

### Instantiating a noun phrase

A noun phrase should be instantiated only once in a claim using one keyword phrase among a set of instantiating keyword phrases:

- `a`,
- `an`,
- `one|two|ùë•`,
- `at least`,
- `each`.

The following are examples of instantiating a noun phrase with a keyword phrase from the set of instantiating keyword phrases:

- `a first thing`,
- `a second thing`,
- `a plurality of things`,
- `one or more things`,
- `two or more things`,
- `three or more things`,
- `at least one thing`,
- `at least two things`.

The `each` instantiating keyword phrase is a special keyword phrase that will be discussed in detail further herein.

### Referring to an instantiated noun phrase

 After a noun phrase is instantiated, the `the` keyword phrase should be used to reference the noun phrase exactly as the noun phrase is instantiated. The following are examples of referring to an instantiated noun phrase:

- `the first thing`,
- `the second thing`,
- `the plurality of things`,
- `the one or more things`,
- `the two or more things`,
- `the three or more things`,
- `the at least one thing`,
- `the at least two things`.

A noun phrase should not be referenced using a modifier, such as an adjective.  For example, if a claims includes `receiving a thing`, then `the thing` should **not** be referenced as `the received thing` in the claim.

### A noun phrase references an immutable object

A noun phrase references an object that is immutable. If the object is modified, then the object is a new object.  Accordingly, a new noun phrase should be instantiated to represent the new object.  The following is an example of assigning a new noun phrase to a modified object:

``` claim
1. A method comprising:
  receiving a first thing;
  modifying the first thing to produce a second thing.
```

Do not make a noun phrase ambiguous by referring to two objects with the same noun phrase.  The following is an example of a claim that creates an antecedent basis error by using a single noun phrase to reference two objects with different states: 

``` claim
1. A method comprising:
  receiving a thing that includes a partiuclar component;
  modifying the particular component included in the thing;
  sending the thing to a person.
```

The following claim is free of antecedent basis errors by assigning a new noun phrase to a modified object:

``` claim
1. A method comprising:
  receiving a first thing that includes a particular component;
  producing a second thing from the first thing by modifying the particular component;
  sending the second thing to a person.
```

### Interating through a plurlaity of things

``` claim
for each thing among a plurality of things:
  doing a first action with the thing; 
  doing a second action with the thing;
```
