## DNUOPOHTRAITCOS: Do Not Use Obscure, Proprietary, Or Hard To Remember Acronyms In The Claims Or Specification

Do not use an acronym unless the acronym is more common than the underlying words. The same goes for an abbreviation.

HTTP, RAM, API are acceptable acronyms. Each acronym is acceptable because the acronym is more widely known and used than the words that the acronym represents.
